This library is inspired by Lewis Bakers' cppcoro library, which also served as a guide to implementing
the coroutine machinery, alongside his great series on C++ coroutines:

 * [Coroutine Theory](https://lewissbaker.github.io/2017/09/25/coroutine-theory)
 * [Understanding Operator co_await](https://lewissbaker.github.io/2017/11/17/understanding-operator-co-await)
 * [Understanding the promise type](https://lewissbaker.github.io/2018/09/05/understanding-the-promise-type)
 * [Understanding Symmetric Transfer](https://lewissbaker.github.io/2020/05/11/understanding_symmetric_transfer)

I can also recommend numerous articles about C++ coroutines by [Raymond Chen on his blog OldNewThink][oldnewthing].
